| Description | Data are provided by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA). This data set includes total trips taken by bus, metro, rail, and mobility/paratransit services. Beginning in FY2014, the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) began counting Core Bus ridership using an Automated Passenger Count (APC) system to better track the number of people boarding and leaving the buses. In order to maintain the integrity of historical comparisons for the Transit Ridership Goal, the MTA used ridership estimate differences between the new APC system and previous counting estimates for its Bus Service to allow for apples-to-apples comparisons between fiscal years. |

### Employee Compensation by Industry in Iowa

| Name | Employee Compensation by Industry in Iowa |
| State | [Iowa](https://data.iowa.gov) |
| Description | This dataset contains employee compensation estimates in thousands of dollars, seasonally adjusted at annual rates.  All dollar estimates are in current dollars (not adjusted for inflation).  Compensation is the total remuneration, both monetary and in kind, payable by employers to employees in return for their work during the period. It consists of wages and salaries and of supplements to wages and salaries. Compensation is presented on an accrual basis - that is, it reflects compensation liabilities incurred by the employer in a given period regardless of when the compensation is actually received by the employee. The estimates of compensation by industry for 1998-2006 are based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The estimates for 2007-2010 are based on the 2007 NAICS. The estimates for 2011 forward are based on the 2012 NAICS. |

### Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2015

|:---|:---|
| Id | rybz-nyjw |
| Name | Accidental Drug Related Deaths  2012-2015 |
| State | [Connecticut](https://data.ct.gov) |
| Description | A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2015. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates whether that particular substance was detected. Data is derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation. The "Morphine (Not Heroin)" values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefore detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as "Morphine (not heroin)." Therefore, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated. "Any Opioid" – if the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether the cause of death is from RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked |
