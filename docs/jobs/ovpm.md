# OVPM Job

OVPM protocol is used to retrieve data from the HP OpenView Performance Manager.

## Job Settings

Apart from the general job settings that are specified in the [Axibase Collector Jobs](../job-generic.md), OVMP job has an additional job-specific parameter. 

**Max. serial errors threshold** - defines the maximum amount of consecutive errors after which no more queries will be sent.
